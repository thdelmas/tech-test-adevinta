# Adevinta Technical Challenge

## Specifications
```
Write a simple fizz-buzz REST server.

"The original fizz-buzz consists in writing all numbers from 1 to 100, and just replacing all multiples of 3 by ""fizz"", all multiples of 5 by ""buzz"", and all multiples of 15 by ""fizzbuzz"".
The output would look like this: ""1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,...""."

Your goal is to implement a web server that will expose a REST API endpoint that:
- Accepts five parameters: three integers int1, int2 and limit, and two strings str1 and str2.
- Returns a list of strings with numbers from 1 to limit, where: all multiples of int1 are replaced by str1, all multiples of int2 are replaced by str2, all multiples of int1 and int2 are replaced by str1str2.

The server needs to be:
- Ready for production
- Easy to maintain by other developers

Bonus: add a statistics endpoint allowing users to know what the most frequent request has been. This endpoint should:
- Accept no parameter
- Return the parameters corresponding to the most used request, as well as the number of hits for this request
```

## What's FizzBuzz

> Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
>
> Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz".
> 
> Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "one", and the players then count upwards in turn.
>
> However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five is replaced by the word buzz.
>
> Numbers divisible by both three and five (i.e. divisible by fifteen) become fizz buzz.
> 
> For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:
>
> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
